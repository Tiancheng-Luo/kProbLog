kProlog was developed under OSX and ran on Ubuntu/Linux on the Anaconda 2 (64-bit) Python distribution.

Install ProbLog 2.1.0.7 as dependency.
$ pip install problog==2.1.0.7

Make sure that also SDDs are installed.
Enter the python interpreter
$ python

and type the following commands

>>> import problog
>>> problog.setup.install()
running build_ext
{'sdd_module': True, 'python_version': sys.version_info(major=2, minor=7, micro=11, releaselevel='final', serial=0), 'root_path': '/Users/francesco/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/problog/..', 'dsharp': True, 'c2d': False, 'pyparsing': '1.5.6', 'os': 'darwin'}
>>> exit()

Now you can run the kProlog scripts from the shell perhaps:

$ python run_linear_system.py
